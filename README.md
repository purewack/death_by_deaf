# L U A T I F

Re-imagined  M O T I F backend powered by Lua

Core audio stuff in C++ 🔊
Slower functions and UI in lua 🌖

Done so far ✅
- Lua is embedded into system
- Scripts act as screens, no more complex hard coded UIs
- VElements for UI, no direct drawing (although possible wrapping in the future)
- per-frame animation function
- VActions for event-based animation
- Message banner
- Navigation between scripts with possible animated transitions

Left to do 📝
- Button light functions
- Input event handlers 
- Midi mapped handlers
- Wrapper for clips tracks launcher and effects and all things audio
- Navigable traversal 
- (VWaveform)
